# Analysis_and_design_of_algorithms
These programs are made by me with my understanding of the concept. They are my college practical assignments which I wrote in C language. 


# About files
IDE      : Dev C++
Language : C
NOTE: These programs may not run  in VSC as Dev C++ is inferior to VSC. You need to come few changes like type of declaring main() function and so on.


# Practicals

# 1. Implementation and Time analysis of factorial program using iterative and recursive method
=> Factorial program in both Iterative and Recursive manner

# 2. Implementation and Time analysis of sorting algorithms: Bubble sort 
=> Time analysis and implementation of Bubble sort with all its versions

# 3. Implementation and Time analysis of sorting algorithms: Selection sort
=> Time analysis and implementation of Selection sort

# 4. Insertion Sort

# 5. Shell Sort
=> Shell sort is made using one of the part of insertion sort

# 6. Heap Sort

# 7. Counting Sort

# 8. Knap Sack using Greedy Algorithm
